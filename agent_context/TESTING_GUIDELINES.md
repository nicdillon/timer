# Testing Guidelines for New Code

This document outlines the testing practices that must be followed for any new code generated for the project. The goal is to ensure that all new features are robust, maintainable, and do not break existing functionality.

## 1. Unit Testing
- **Coverage:** Write unit tests for each new function or module. Aim for comprehensive test coverage that includes edge cases.
- **Frameworks:** Use appropriate testing frameworks (e.g., Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript) to automate and run tests.
- **Isolation:** Tests should isolate components and functions to ensure that failures pinpoint the exact source of an issue.

## 2. Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Scenarios:** Develop integration tests that simulate real user scenarios and interactions across components.
- **Data Flow Testing:** Verify that data passed between modules or components is correctly handled and formatted.

## 3. Automated Testing & CI/CD
- **Continuous Integration:** Set up CI/CD pipelines to automatically run tests on every commit and pull request.
- **Automated Alerts:** Configure alerts for failed tests to enable prompt fixes.
- **Regression Testing:** Regularly run a suite of regression tests to catch unexpected side effects from new changes.

## 4. Testing in Different Environments
- **Browser Testing:** For front-end code, test across multiple browsers and devices (using emulation tools and real device testing).
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluate the performance impact of new code and ensure that it doesnâ€™t degrade the user experience, especially on mobile devices.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Include tests for accessibility features to ensure compliance with standards (e.g., using tools like Axe).

## 5. Documentation & Best Practices
- **Test Documentation:** Clearly document the purpose and usage of each test. Comments should explain why a test exists and what behavior it verifies.
- **Mocking & Stubs:** Use mocks and stubs to simulate external dependencies and ensure that tests are reliable and repeatable.
- **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review and update tests to ensure they remain relevant as the codebase evolves.
