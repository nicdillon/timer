# Coding Guidelines for Mobile-Optimized UI Development in Next.js

This document provides coding guidelines intended to steer the development process for a mobile-friendly and visually appealing Next.js application. These guidelines can be used by coding assistants such as Copilot to generate code that adheres to our quality and performance standards.

## 1. General Coding Guidelines
- **Code Readability:** Write clean, modular, and well-documented code. Use clear naming conventions and add comments where necessary.
- **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML elements to improve SEO and accessibility (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- **Responsive Design:** Incorporate CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques to ensure compatibility across devices.

## 2. Next.js Specific Guidelines
- **Page Optimization:**
  - Use Next.jsâ€™s SSR/SSG capabilities to pre-render pages for improved performance.
  - Implement `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` for data fetching where appropriate.
- **Image Handling:**
  - Use the `next/image` component for automatic image optimization and responsive delivery.
- **Dynamic Imports:**
  - Leverage dynamic imports (`import('...')`) to load components only when needed, reducing the initial load time.
- **Meta & SEO:**
  - Utilize `next/head` to manage metadata (viewport, description, keywords) for each page.
- **Scoped Styling:**
  - Prefer CSS Modules or styled JSX for component-level styling to avoid global style conflicts.
- **Component Reusability:**
  - Create reusable components and maintain a consistent design system across the application.

## 3. Accessibility & User Experience
- **Touch-Optimized Elements:**
  - Ensure that buttons and interactive elements are appropriately sized and spaced.
- **Contrast & Readability:**
  - Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and background elements.
- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Implement keyboard navigation support and proper focus management.
- **ARIA Labels:**
  - Use ARIA attributes where needed to enhance the experience for users relying on assistive technologies.

## 4. Performance & Testing
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize code for fast loading times. Keep JavaScript bundles lean through code splitting and lazy loading.
- **Testing on Multiple Devices:**
  - Test layouts on various screen sizes using device emulation in browser tools and real device testing.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:**
  - Integrate tools to monitor web vitals and performance metrics, and optimize based on the collected data.

## 5. Collaboration & Code Reviews
- **Documentation:** 
  - Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes or new features.
- **Pull Requests:** 
  - Ensure that code is reviewed by peers and that best practices are followed before merging.
- **Feedback Loop:** 
  - Regularly update these guidelines based on team feedback and evolving best practices.
